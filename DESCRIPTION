Title: Embedded JavaScript Engine for R
Version: 1.9000
Author: Jeroen Ooms
Maintainer: Jeroen Ooms <jeroen@berkeley.edu>
Description: An R interface to Google's open source JavaScript engine. This 
    package can now be compiled either with V8 version 6.8 (LTS) or with the 
    legacy 3.14/3.15 version of V8. In the latter case, only ECMAScript v5 
    is supported, hence promises and async functionality won't work.
